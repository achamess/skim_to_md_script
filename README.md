# skim_to_md

This is a script in python that takes highlighted text from a PDF in [Skim.app]() and produces individual markdown files for each highlight. 

This is a work in progress and eventually, I hope to add additional features.

## Requirements
- [skimnotes - command line tool for Skim.app](https://sourceforge.net/projects/skim-app/files/SkimNotes%20framework%20and%20tool/)

## Roadmap

- Format notes using a templating engine such as Django or Jinja2
- Add additional information to the final note, including a bibtex citekey and full reference 
- Add additional fields in the markdown note for comments, thoughts, and related information.
