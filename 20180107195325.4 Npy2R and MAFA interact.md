## Summary:
 Npy2R and MAFA interact

>We next tested whether concurrent activation of LTMRs and A-fiber nociceptors evokes different pain behaviors compared to selective activation of A-fiber nociceptors. To this end, we crossed Npy2rChR2 mice with MafAChR2 mice. Strikingly, only one from seven Npy2rChR2;MafAChR2 double transgenic mice briefly squeaked, whereas all Npy2rChR2 mice vocalized for several seconds in response to photostimulation at frequencies above 5 Hz (Figure 7A; Movies S2 and S
