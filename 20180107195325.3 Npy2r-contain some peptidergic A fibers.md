## Summary:
 Npy2r-contain some peptidergic A fibers


## Quote:
>Taken together, our immunohistochemical characterization demonstrates that NPY2R-ChR2-positive fibers terminate as free nerve endings in the epidermis of the hairy and glabrous skin of the hindpaw, which is characteristic of nociceptive afferents, whereas they form both free nerve endings and lanceolate endings around guard hairs in the hairy back skin. This peripheral nerve terminal morphology of hindpaw afferents is consistent with the neurochemical marker profile found in lumbar DRGs and, together with the functional data from the skin-nerve recordings, strongly suggests that NPY2R-ChR2-positive afferents innervating the paw skin constitute a subset of peptidergic myelinated A-fiber nociceptors.
