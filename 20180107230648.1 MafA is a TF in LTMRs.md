## Summary:
 MafA is a TF in LTMRs


## Quote:
>To directly test this hypothesis, we generated a MafACre mouse line to enable selective optogenetic control of LTMRs (Figure S5A). MafA is a transcription factor that is specifically expressed in LTMRs (Bourane et al., 2009; Wende et al., 2012). Accordingly, in MafAChR2 mice, ChR2-positive lumbar DRG neurons co-expressed neurochemical markers of LTMRs, but not nociceptor markers.
