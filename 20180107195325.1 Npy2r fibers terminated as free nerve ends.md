## Summary:
 Npy2r fibers terminated as free nerve ends


## Quote:
>We next examined the peripheral and central projection patterns of ChR2-expressing neurons in Npy2rChR2 mice. In the hindpaw skin, ChR2-positive afferents terminated as myelinated (NEFH+) free nerve endings (Figure 3A), which are characteristic of nociceptive sensory afferents (Basbaum et al., 2009; Dubin and Patapoutian, 2010). By contrast, sensory end organs of LTMRs were not innervated by ChR2-expressing fibers. Thus, lanceolate endings and circumferential endings around hair follicles (Figures 3B and 3C), which represent Ab RA-LTMRs (Li et al., 2011) and Ab field-LTMRs (Bai et al., 2015), respectively, did not show ChR2-EYFP immunoreactivity.
